   <p>Fermented corn dough porridge, locally known as <em>Mmore Koko</em>  is a traditional Ghanaian dish that is both delicious and nutritious. It is a good source of carbohydrates, protein, and fiber. The fermentation process also helps to break down the starch in the cornmeal, making it easier to digest.</p>
  <p><em>Mmore Koko</em> can be served plain or with a variety of toppings, such as sugar, honey, milk, or fruit.</p>
    <p>Here is everything you will need to make <em>Mmore Koko</em>: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup corn dough</li>
      <li>1 small ginger</li>
      <li>4 dried chili peppers</li>
      <li>4 bell peppers</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now that you've sorted the ingredients out let's get to making some spicy corn dough porridge</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Grind the chili and ginger, add 1/4 water and pass the mixture trough a fine sieve. Use an earthen ware or motor and pestle to grind if possible.</li>
      <li>Add 1 1/2 cups of water to the corn dough, mix properly and pass it through a fine sieve.Pour sieved dough into a pot. Sieve it twice if you're using a normal sieve. </li>
      <li>Lightly crush the bell peppers and add to the dough mixture. Add the sieved ginger and chili. Add a pinch of salt and bring mixture to a boil.</li>
      <li>Stir continuously in a circular manner until it thickens up then add 1 cup of water. Stir and allow to cook until it thickens up again. If porridge is too thick, add a small amount water to thin it.</li>
      <li>Remove the peppers and serve with sugar and milk (optional) and bread or anything really.</li>

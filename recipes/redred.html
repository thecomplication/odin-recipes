Made with black-eyed peas in a rich tomato base, this Ghanaian red red stew is a good addition to your healthy lunch or dinner menu. Here is a recommended list of steps to make it.</p> 
    <p>Here is everything you will need to make this delicious vegan stew:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>black-eyed peas</li>
      <li>Palm Oil</li>
      <li>Onions</li>
      <li>Bell Peppers</li>
      <li>Tomatoes</li>
      <li>Bouillon cubes</li>
      <li>Tomato sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now that you've sorted the ingredients out let's get to making some Fried Plantain and Beans</p>
    <ol>
      <li>First of all, you have to soak the black-eyed peas. You can do that by washing the dried beans and then soaking them for about 8 hours overnight.</li>
      <li>Once they are soaked long enough, drain the black-eyed peas and wash them again with water. Place the black-eyed peas in a medium-sized pot and pour enough water to cover them, and the water level is about two inches above the black-eyed peas. Place the pot over medium heat and let the black-eyed peas cook for about 60 minutes or until they are tender. Once done, set them aside.</li>
      <li>Heat two tablespoons of palm oil in a large pot. Add chopped onion and cook for about 3 minutes until they are soft.</li>
      <li>Add grated ginger, minced garlic, bell pepper, and green onion. Sauté for a minute or two. Next, add chopped tomatoes, tomato sauce, bouillon, cayenne pepper, curry powder, black-eyed peas, and black pepper.</li>
      <li>Mix well and let it cook for about 10 minutes. Using a potato masher, mash black-eyed peas slightly so that the stew gets creamy.</li>
      <li>Add two tablespoons of palm oil and Season it with salt.Garnish with gari powder if you like. Serve with either baked or fried plantains.</li>
    </ol>
